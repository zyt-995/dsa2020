## Explanation
-  Since the problem is written in English,I'll write explanation in English as well.:smile:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible m-ary trees that can produce a given pre-order and post-order traversal. This is a complex problem that involves understanding the structure of m-ary trees and how pre-order and post-order traversals are constructed.

## Approach
1. Tree Traversal Basics:
Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, then the children from left to right.
Post-order traversal: Visit the children from left to right, then the root.
2. Problem Breakdown:
Given the pre-order and post-order traversals, we need to count the number of possible m-ary trees that can produce these traversals.
The key is to identify the subtrees and how they are arranged.
3. Recursive Counting:
For each node in the pre-order traversal, determine its position in the post-order traversal.
Recursively count the number of ways to arrange its children.
4. Combining Results:
Use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of ways to arrange the children nodes.
